## Creating the Virtual Machine

The following section outlines the process for creating a Windows Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure.  
This includes selecting a resource group, choosing an operating system, configuring the VM size,  
and preparing login credentials that will later be used to access the machine via Remote Desktop.
